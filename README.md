# Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_Assignment

README.md:      explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
tidy_ data.txt: the tidy data set 
Cookbook.md:    describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
run_anaysis.R:  does the following...
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
